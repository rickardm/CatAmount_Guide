\chapter{GUI}

The GUI is an independent entity that is able to work with and
orchestrate the other entities. It is implemented with Tkinter, which
it easy to work with, somewhat universal, and not hard to set up.

The GUI communicates with the major functions using their command line
interfaces. It issues commands based on the settings in the GUI, and
receives any text and image feedback that were created. This modular
approach was chosen so that the GUI and command line interface could
function at the same time, each offering its own benefits. The GUI
offers ease of use and browsing, the command line offers systematic
access and scriptability.

To get started with the GUI, you really just need to launch the
\texttt{tkcatamount.pyw} file, and then click on everything until you
have it all figured out.

You can launch the GUI like this (Mac OS X example):

\begin{verbatim}
    cd /User/joe/Desktop/catamount
    ./tkcatamount.pyw
\end{verbatim}

\section{GUI Files}

The CatAmount GUI is represented in the files by the following file:

\begin{verbatim}
    catamount/tkcatamount.pyw
\end{verbatim}
