\section{Perhaps Python 3 Is Already Installed}

A Linux computer will frequently already have Python 3 installed.
You can if you have Python 3 installed like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    python3 --version
\end{verbatim}

The results should be a recent stable version of Python. When I wrote
this in 2019, I had Pyton 3.7.2 installed.


\section{Install Python 3}

For many versions of Linux, you can install Python 3 via your package
manager. I will give one example for my system, and you can probably
adapt it for whatever installation method you use:

\begin{verbatim}
    apt install python3
\end{verbatim}
