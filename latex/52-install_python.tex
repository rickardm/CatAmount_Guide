\chapter{Install Python On Linux}
\hypertarget{linux-install-python}{}

Python is a popular high-level programming language. CatAmount was
moved to Python 3 in 2019.

\section{Check If Python 3 Is Already Installed}

A Linux computer will frequently already have Python 3 installed.
You can check if you have Python 3 installed by opening a console
application and checking the Python 3 version number, like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ python3 --version
\end{verbatim}

The results should be a recent stable version of Python. When I wrote
this in 2019, I had Python 3.7.2 installed.

\section{Install Python 3}

For many versions of Linux, you can install Python 3 via your package
manager. I will give one example for my system, and you can probably
adapt it for whatever installation method you use:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ apt update
    $ apt install python3
\end{verbatim}

\section{Test Python 3 Is Working}

Open a console application and check the python version number like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ python3 --version
\end{verbatim}

\section{Python 3.7.2 Is Just An Example}

I have mentioned Python 3.7.2 and 3.7 several times. These were the
most recent stable versions of Python 3 when I wrote this. As time
goes on, the Python 3 versions will march upwards. You should install
the most recent stable version of Python 3.
