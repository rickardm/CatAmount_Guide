\chapter{Install Libraries On Linux}
\hypertarget{linux-install-libraries}{}

CatAmount uses common Python modules or libraries, and I am able
to install everything using a package manager.

Here is an example for Debian GNU/Linux.

\begin{verbatim}
    $ apt install python3-dateutil python3-pil python3-tk
\end{verbatim}

Package names for the different versions and modules will vary between
distributions. Try to install the prerequisites, then try running one
of the scripts. If it fails to run because of some missing module, figure
out how to install that missing module on your distribution.
