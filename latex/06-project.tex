\chapter{Project}
\hypertarget{project}{}

A Python ``project'' is a way of organizing code so that it is
modular and shareable. The CatAmount project contains a number
of modules that are neatly divided according to function. Each
module contains a handful of classes, for the most part.

Each module in the project is dedicated to a particular major
function of the software. The only one that breaks this rule,
\verb=common.py=, has code that is common to all the different
functions.
