\chapter{Project}
\hypertarget{project}{}

A Python ``project'' is a way of organizing code so that it is
modular and shareable. The CatAmount project contains a number
of modules that are neatly divided according to function. Each
module contains a handful of classes, for the most part.

Most modules in the project are dedicated to a particular major
function of the software. The module \texttt{common.py} has code that is
common to all the different functions. There are also other special
purpose modules included here.
