\chapter{Overview}

CatAmount is made of several parts that work together to make a
functioning whole. This chapter explains what all the major functional
parts are, as a way of providing an overview of the software.

The basic model of the software is to have each major function
accessible by a full command line interface. Then there is a GUI layer
that communicates with the major functions using their command line
interfaces. Blocks of common code that are needed by several functions
are stored separately. A configuration file stores settings between
sessions.


\section{Components}

This section will provide an outline of the major functional
components, and a brief reminder of what they do. Each of these
components is described in more detail in a subsequent section.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hyperlink{configuration-file}{Configuration File}. A plain text
  configuration file that enables you to save common settings between
  sessions.

\item \hyperlink{data-file}{Data File}. A comma-separated data file
  containing the GPS data you wish to analyze.

\item \hyperlink{output-directory}{Output Directory}. A scratch
  directory that CatAmount can use to write out image files.

\item \hyperlink{project}{Project}. A simple python ``project'' that
  is used to make the code modular and shareable.

\item \hyperlink{find-clusters}{Find Clusters}. A major function of
  the software: Analyzes GPS data to find one cat's time/space
  groupings, called clusters.

\item \hyperlink{show-territories}{Show Territories}. A major function
  of the software: Processes GPS data to create color-coded depictions
  of one or more cat's territory.

\item \hyperlink{find-crossings}{Find Crossings}. A major function of
  the software: Analyzes GPS data to find instances where two or more
  cats shared the same place in time/space, called crossings.

\item \hyperlink{find-whodunit}{Find Whodunit}. A major function of
  the software: Search through GPS data to find which cat was at a
  certain time and location.

\item \hyperlink{match-survey-to-cluster}{Match Survey To Cluster}. A
  major function of the software. Attempt to find matches between a
  list of field-verified site surveys, and a list of GPS clusters.

\item \hyperlink{gui}{GUI}. A Tkinter GUI which allows easy operation
  of all major functions, and easy manipulation of settings and
  output.

\item \hyperlink{font}{Font}. These are fonts that are needed by the
  image-creating functions.

\end{enumerate}
